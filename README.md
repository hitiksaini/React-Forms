# `Twitter-Timeline Challenge`

This assignment is a part of [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com/) Campus placement drive at Chandigarh University. Though I have never worked in PHP but I'll apply my web dev skills to this project and see how it goes :) All the resources are mentioned below(links provided)

### `Statements:`

We have divided the assignment into 3 parts to help define the objectives for each accurately. It is necessary to complete all parts in order to complete the challenge.

#### `Part-1: User Timeline`

* Start ➞ User visits your script page.
* The user will be asked to connect using his Twitter account using Twitter Auth.
* After authentication, your script will pull the latest 10 tweets from his “home” timeline.
* 10 tweets will be displayed using a pure CSS and Plain JS slideshow.


#### `Part-2: Followers Timeline`
* Below the slideshow (in step#4 from part-1), display a list of 10 followers (you can take any 10, random followers).
* Also, display a search followers box. Add auto-suggest support. That means as soon as the user starts typing, his followers will start showing up.
* When the user will click on a follower name, 10 tweets from that follower’s user timeline will be displayed in the same slider, without a page refresh (use AJAX).



#### `Part-3: Download Followers`
* There will be a download button to download all followers of any user (we will input user @handler).
* The download can be performed in one of the following formats i.e. You choose the format you want. It would act as an advantage if you give the option to download the followers in all the following formats: google-spreadsheet, pdf, and XML formats.
* For the Google-spreadsheet export feature, your app-user must have a Google account. Your app should ask for permission to create a spreadsheet on the user’s Google Drive.
* Once the user clicks the download button (after choosing the option) all followers of the specified user should be downloaded.


`Please note that we are aware of Twitter API limits for retrieving tweets/follower’s data although you have to overcome these by thinking outside the box like we do at rtCamp.`

### `Resources used:`

I will be collectively mentioning them in the end of project :)
